# EDA_on_onlineretails
This is an another project in which i have Performed Exploratory data analysis on a dataset about online retailers.
## The goal of EDA is to leverage visualization tools, summary tables, and hypothesis testing to:
    1. Provide summary level insight into a dataset.
    2. Uncover underlying patterns and structures in you data.
    3. Identify outliers, missing data, class balance, and other data-related issues.
    4.Relate the available data to the business opportunity
    
    
## About the dataset ::
This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.

## Important NOte ::
Business scenario here is that the management team expects to spend less time in projection models and gain more accuracy in forecasting revenue. It is expected that well projected numbers will help stabilize staffing and budget projections which will have a beneficial ripple effect throughout the company.

## Use tables, text and visualizations to tell the story that relates the business opportunity to the data.
## Here, the data is leveraged to calculate the monthly revenue of the online retail store. Since one of the goals of this case study is forecasting revenue, therefore it is important to quantify revenue using such formulae which can later be utilized either in supervised learning or for hypothesis testing.

## Missing values are generally dealt with depending on the category of missingness i.e 
  MCAR (Missing completely at random)
  MAR (Missing at random)
  MNAR (Missing not at random). 
## If the missing data are not MCAR, then imputing values can result in an increase in bias and therefore it is very important to have train/test split.
